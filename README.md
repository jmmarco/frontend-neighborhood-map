### Questions 1 on 1 with JohnMav

- Separation of concerns, viewModel, map Function etc - KO Computed (when to use them)
- Markers, do I need to define a marker variable on each hardcoded location?
- Async scripts all have to be async, which ones do I want to defer?
- How to make the list appear over the MAP (css)?
